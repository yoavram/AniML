# AniML
## Machine learning with AI coding agent for Zoologists
## [Yoav Ram](https://www.yoavram.com)

## 📘 Workshop Overview
This one-day workshop introduces zoology graduate students and researchers to machine learning using AI coding agents. 
We move beyond manual Python and R coding to automating data-science pipelines using AI coding agents.

All analysis will be done in **VS Code** with **GitHub Copilot**.
