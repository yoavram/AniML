# AniML
## Machine learning with AI coding agent for Zoologists
## [Yoav Ram](https://www.yoavram.com)

## 📘 Workshop Overview
This 4-hour workshop introduces zoology graduate students to machine learning using AI coding agent. 
We move beyond manual Python/R coding to automating data science pipelines with AI coding agents.

All analysis will be done in **VS Code** with **GitHub Copilot**.

## 🛠 Prerequisites
1. Install [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download).
1. If you don't already have one, [create a GitHub account](https://education.github.com).
1. [Verify your student status on GitHub](https://education.github.com/pack). Submitted applications are sometimes reviewed within the hour or at most within a day.
1. Connect Copilot to Github: Go to the [Copilot website](https://copilot.github.com ) and log in. Then, go to the Settings section and connect your Github account to Copilot.
1. Setup [Github Copilot in VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/copilot/setup)
1. Install Python and/or R:
  - [R in VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/languages/r)
  - [Python in VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/languages/python)
